# Hi, I'm Skull

I am a backend-focused software engineer and learner with a strong interest in systems, Linux, and building practical products. I focus on understanding fundamentals deeply while continuously shipping small but complete projects.

## 🎯 Focus
- Backend Development (Go, API design)
- System & Linux Engineering
- Building and refining real-world products

## 🚀 Featured Projects
- **Tasker CLI**  
  A Go-based command-line task manager focused on simplicity, clarity, and maintainable structure.

- **Product-Oriented Backend Services**  
  Backend projects designed with clean architecture, clear boundaries, and production-oriented thinking.

- **Learning Repositories (Data Structures & Algorithms)**  
  Structured documentation and implementations of core data structures and sorting algorithms, written with a teaching mindset.

## 📚 Learning & Documentation
I document my learning publicly to strengthen understanding and maintain long-term consistency.  
My repositories separate production-ready projects from learning spaces and experimental labs, making intent clear and easy to evaluate.

Playground and experimental repositories are explicitly labeled and used to explore concepts such as system behavior, concurrency, and low-level details—without presenting them as finished products.
